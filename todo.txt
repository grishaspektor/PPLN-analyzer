1. make automatic rotation.


1.5 make that the line profile excludes some pixels from the edges.
make this ADJUSTABLE!


2. make all the calculations - duty cycle, period, std, 
period as a function of location data, duty cycle as a function of location.
Outlier-removed data(?)

3. make all the saving functionality.
insert the Run, chip number, device number(?), 
Electrode Period, Electrode Separation, Electrode Duty Cycle, Electrode shape(?)
Description (optional), image path, rotation angle

Save button


These values should default to something.

Think of storing some sort of processing file that if an already processed image is loaded - it loads the: rotation angle - what else?


keep account on how many lines is the period averaged.
Average over ROI or make statistics over #N line scans?

Add a "this image has been analyzed" notice somehow.


Make sure that the order of operations is somehow enforced:
1. load image.
2. rotate.
3. calibrate microns per pixel
4. get period
By adding arrows between the buttons?
