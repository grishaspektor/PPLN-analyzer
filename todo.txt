1.5 make that the line profile excludes some pixels from the edges.
make this ADJUSTABLE! - make it with sliders


1. make automatic rotation.


3. make all the saving functionality.
insert the Run, chip number, device number(?)

Pulse parameters - make a separate menu for that that will have some default values that are changeable from a button.


Think of storing some sort of processing file that if an already processed image is loaded - it loads the: rotation angle - what else?


keep account on how many lines is the period averaged.
Average over ROI or make statistics over #N line scans?

Add a "this image has been analyzed" notice somehow.


Make sure that the order of operations is somehow enforced:
1. load image.
2. rotate.
3. calibrate microns per pixel
4. get period
By adding arrows between the buttons?
